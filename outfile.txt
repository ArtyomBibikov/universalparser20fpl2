Lyrics:
Oh, not again, now the train’s gone and left
And the cities too far to walk to the end, while I
Can’t call to mind all the words if I try, I find
To pocket them will keep them all alive
Wheeze through the night as my lungs burn inside
As I fake through the day that never subsides if I
Can’t call to mind all the words or the lines, I’ll try
To ride the train wherever it will go tonight 

Block out the night all the boring noise that calls me to the world outside
Better not to try, just let me stay alone and well-hidden--shun the light
And look, right there the crosswalk’s waiting, “please, hurry up” and come to me
The curb restrains and binds my body cut my ties and set me free, I need--

Oh, not again, now the train’s gone and left
And the cities too far to walk to the end, while I
Can’t call to mind all the words if I try, I find
To pocket them will keep them all alive
Wheeze through the night as my lungs burn inside
As I fake through the day that never subsides if I
Can’t call to mind all the words or the lines, I’ll try
To ride the train wherever it will go tonight 

Riding through the night the evening train is filled with people buzzing all around
Let me clear my mind, until I’m all alone and sitting without a sound
Again, oh god, the groups returning
And the school bell it moves you forward
And look, the ticket booth is waiting, “please, hurry up” and come to me
My hands are full and halt your freedom, cut your ties and set me free, I need--

Wheeze through the night as my lungs burn inside
As I fake through the day that never subsides if I
Can’t call to mind all the words or the lines, I’ll try
To ride the train wherever it will go tonight 

Oh not again the train has gone and left
The town will never end
The wind will cut to bits the world below 
Please leave me be, don’t go
The words I couldn’t call to mind, it’s fine if you just let them be
If that would mean that you would stay with me just like the train, I need--

Oh, not again, now the train’s gone and left
Oh, not again, now the train’s gone and left
And the time to part won’t come back again, while I
Can’t call to mind all the words if I try, I find
To pocket them will keep them all alive
Wheeze through the night as my lungs burn inside
As I fake through the day that never subsides if I
Can’t call to mind all the words or the lines, I’ll try
To ride the train wherever it is going tonight
