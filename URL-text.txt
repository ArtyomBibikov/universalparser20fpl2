Going to follow up this post with some advice:
If you're reposting anything you think is new, provocative, or even questionable: Do yourself a favor and reverse image search before you post it.
Takes seconds and can save everyone from spreading disinfo. Not that the supposed photo of the pilot being a few years out of date is really important to check the accuracy of: but the same lesson can be applied to other tweets about the conflict.

Promiment ones to use are of course,
Google Image Seach
Yandex image search is actually your BEST bet because it's a Russian search engine. Meaning it'll have access to more media from that side of the world.
TinyEye is pretty particular about the resolution being similar to what it might find, but is still worth checking.

Here are some other city names' Russian vs. Ukrainian transliterations if anyone wishes to adjust how they refer to them:

Ukrainian: "Odesa"; Russian: "Odessa"
Ukrainian: "Chernihiv"; Russian: "Chernigov"
Ukrainian: "Prypyat"/"Pryp'yat"; Russian: "Pripyat"
Ukrainian: "Chornobyl"; Russian: "Chernobyl"
Ukrainian: "Donbas"; Russian: "Donbass"
Ukrainian: "Kharkiv"; Russian: "Kharkov"

I'll update this with some more city names commonly referred to with the Russian version if I find any. I just noticed a few news orgs use "Chornobyl" instead of "Chernobyl" when referring to the ongoing fighting, so it looks like that's gaining some traction at least.

Shame, seems that they got a train to traverse one track at least.

Can anyone actually confirm this? Lot of people in the replies pointing out that this looks like a completely different bridge.

Would they be having to remove that blown up rail car that soon?

Reading that one of Zelensky's advisers said the bridge attack was likely the result of an internal struggle in Russia rather than an Ukranian attack. Could be disinfo to leave the Russians guessing, but could also be a sign of more partisan attacks to come.

Empty cars traversing a track don't mean anything. I want to see them try driving a military echelon over it. I double dare them to do it.

The sky military reporter said it would probably be back into function in half a month but arguably the damage has already been done. Not only will logistics be backed up by the amount of repair time, alternate routes will be more congested, Russia will have to divert resources to repair it and then keep an even higher defensive presence around the bridge now.

If it can be struck once, it can be struck again.

Depends if they were empty or not, which we cannot tell from the video. Those were gondolas, a high-walled open-top railroad car primarily used to haul aggregate dry bulk like coal, gravel, dirt, and various types of ore. Because it's an open-top car, the only way to tell if it's empty or not is to see the top of it, and the camera is at way too low an angle to see that.
A full gondola is about the heaviest railcar you could get, just because rocks are really heavy. Theoretically if you wanted to actively test the integrity of the bridge, a train pulling gondolas full of gravel would be a quick and cheap way to do that. No other train will match that weight except possibly one carrying lots of tanks.

Seems that they haven't cleared the burnt up train at the end of the video, so they're using the one track furthest away from the blast.

edit:

looks to me like the explosion was on top of the bridge. No charring underneath, the edges of the hole in the bridge (see at the waterline) are pushed downward, and the guard rails from earlier all indicate it imo.

I've been waiting for the Kerch Bridge to get hit ever since this wars started so I'm freaking ecstatic today.

Also,

Nice.
